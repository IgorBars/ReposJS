    <p>In this example, the image is taller than the element containing it, and it is floated, so it overflows outside of 
        its container:</p>

    <div>
    <img class="img1" src="../../vscode_img/Flatland.jpg" alt="Pineapple" width="170" height="170">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum...</div>
    
    <p style="clear:right">Add the clearfix hack to the containing element, to fix this problem:</p>
    
    <div class="clearfix">
    <img class="img1" src="../../vscode_img/Flatland.jpg" alt="Pineapple" width="170" height="170">
    <img class="img2" src="../../vscode_img/Flatland.jpg" alt="Pineapple" width="170" height="170" >
