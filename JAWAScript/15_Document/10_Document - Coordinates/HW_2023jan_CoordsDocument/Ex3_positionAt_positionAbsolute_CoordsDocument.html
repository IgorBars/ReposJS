    <p>This Ecma Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most well known being JavaScript 
        (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first 
        appeared in that company's Navigator 2.0 browser.
        It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting 
        with Internet Explorer 3.0. The development of this Standard started in November 1996. The first edition 
        of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.</p>

    <p>That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and 
        approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 
        approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262. 
        Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in nature.</p>

    <p>The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular expressions, better string handling, 
        new control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for 
        numeric output and minor changes in anticipation of forthcoming internationalisation facilities and 
        future language growth. The third edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General 
        Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June 2002.</p>

        Teacher: Why are you late?
        Student: There was a man who lost a hundred dollar bill.
        Teacher: That's nice. Were you helping him look for it?
        Student: No. I was standing on it.
